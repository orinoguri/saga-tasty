				This is a Tasty Sage/Food Fantasy project I embarked on in response
				to the current state of the game. I figured it would be a huge waste
				for everything to go before players had a chance to read through all
				the content so I took it upon myself to rip the data from the game
				file to share to everyone. More things will be added in due time but
				for now enjoy the content ^^
