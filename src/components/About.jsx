				This is a Tasty Saga/Food Fantasy content conservation project. The
				content has been amassed from the game files in response to the
				current status of the game. The main goal of this project will be
				display as much information about the Food Souls as possible. The
				priority will be towards the 5-chapter Food Soul stories but will
				eventually work towards displaying more combat related information
				such as skills and artifacts.

				As of right now, I don't know if I will publish CN/JP/global content
				as they already have their respective active wiki.
